 Immediate MVP Priorities
Priority 1: Real-Time Analysis
Add webcam support to your analyzer
Create live feedback display
Essential for VR integration
Priority 2: Unity Integration
Export analysis data to Unity
Create simple VR UI for feedback display
Prototype the VR experience
Priority 3: Enhanced Feedback
Improve coaching quality
Add more detailed analysis
Better user experience
💡 My Recommendation
Start with Priority 1 - Real-time webcam analysis. This will:
✅ Give you immediate MVP functionality
✅ Allow testing with live movement
✅ Provide foundation for VR integration
✅ Show the "AI coach" in action
Would you like me to create the webcam analysis script first? This would be the quickest path to a working MVP that can analyze your movements in real-time and provide immediate feedback.
Or would you prefer to focus on Unity integration first to see the VR experience?
